            <h3>Taj Mahal - India</h3>
            
            <p class="para">The Taj Mahal, located in Agra, India, stands as a timeless testament to love and architectural brilliance. Built in the 17th century by Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan as a mausoleum for his beloved wife Mumtaz Mahal, this UNESCO World Heritage Site is one of the most iconic and universally recognized structures in the world. The Taj Mahal's ethereal beauty lies in its exquisite marble craftsmanship, symmetrical design, and intricate details. The white marble facade, adorned with delicate inlays and calligraphy, reflects different hues with the changing sunlight, creating a mesmerizing spectacle that leaves visitors awestruck.

                Approaching the Taj Mahal through the grand entrance gate is a moment of anticipation, as the grandeur of the monument gradually unveils itself. The perfectly proportioned gardens and reflective pools add to the serenity and enchantment of the site. Stepping inside the mausoleum reveals the marble cenotaphs of Shah Jahan and Mumtaz Mahal, intricately carved with floral motifs and Quranic inscriptions. The delicate marble lattice screens, known as jali, allow soft sunlight to filter through, casting a heavenly glow within the mausoleum.
                
                The Taj Mahal's beauty extends beyond its architectural splendor. It holds a significant historical and cultural legacy, representing the rich heritage of the Mughal Empire. The complex also includes other magnificent structures, such as the red sandstone Agra Fort and the stunning Tomb of Itimad-ud-Daulah, often referred to as the "Baby Taj." Exploring the surrounding area allows visitors to delve deeper into the region's history and experience the fusion of Indian, Persian, and Islamic influences.</p>
